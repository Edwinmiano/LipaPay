Options for Implementing a 1% Fee
While Solana Pay itself doesn't directly support custom fees, you can achieve this by implementing additional logic outside the standard Solana Pay flow. Here are two possible approaches:

1. Adjust Payment Amount on the Frontend
Modify the amount requested from the customer to include the 1% fee before generating the Solana Pay payment request.
Example:
If the customer needs to pay $100, your system calculates the total as:
Total
=
Payment Amount
+
(
Payment Amount
×
1
%
)
Total=Payment Amount+(Payment Amount×1%)
Total = $100 + ($100 × 0.01) = $101.
Display this adjusted amount in the payment request.
Pros:
Simple to implement without additional smart contract logic.
Works seamlessly with the Solana Pay API.
Cons:
Customers must approve the adjusted amount, which might confuse users if not clearly communicated.
2. Use a Smart Contract for Fee Deduction
Instead of directly transferring funds to the recipient wallet, you can create a custom Solana program (smart contract) to handle the payment logic.
Workflow:
Customer sends the full payment to the smart contract.
The smart contract deducts 1% and forwards 99% to the business's wallet.
The 1% fee is sent to a fee-collection wallet.
Pros:
Fully automated and transparent fee handling.
Clear separation of payment and fee logic.
Cons:
Requires Solana smart contract development using Rust and Anchor.
Adds complexity and potential gas costs (still minimal on Solana).
